# Captcha-recognition
This is my first project using neural networks. This program recognizes w3captcha using CNN (convolutional neural networks). Dataset for training was created using source code of captcha. It consists of 100 thousands images that are not repeat. As a result, accuracy of recognition is 1.0.
